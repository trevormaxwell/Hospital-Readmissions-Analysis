# Predicting Hospital Readmiss

## Introduction
This project uses patient data to predict if the patient's treatment at their next visit should be during an inpatient or outpatient stay. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions?resource=download). The ThinkStats2 library is used for the EDA phase, and the GitHub repo for this library can be found [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).
This project consists of the following sections:
 - Data cleaning
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Model

## Data Cleaning
Steps include handling outliers, dropping columns that are not used, and one-hot encoding target variable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explores the dataset with histograms, scatter plots, CDFs, and PMFs. 

## Model
Data is fit to logistic regression model.
